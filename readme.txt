Hello, and welcome to the wxIFM 1.0 distribution. Let me say that this is not
your average readme file. This file contains a message from me, Robin McNeill,
the author of wxIFM, to you, the user of wxIFM. wxIFM release 1.0 is the last
official wxIFM release that will come from me aside from unforseeable major
bugfix releases. I have put a lot of effort into wxIFM and I hope that you are
able to put it to good use. The rest of this file contains a few important pieces
of information for wxIFM users:

Contacting the Author:
To contact me, Robin McNeill, use any of these methods:
email:	snakeb@optonline.net
irc:	irc.freenode.net/#wxwidgets or irc.freenode.net/#wxifm

Getting Help
If you need help with wxIFM, contact me by any of the above methods and I will
try to help you as best I can. Please limit these requests to simple issues
or bugs you encounter but cannot figure out how to fix, or questions about
wxIFM implementation.

Commercial Support
If your company would like to use wxIFM but are having difficulties, or are in
need of a feature not currently present in wxIFM, I am prepared to offer
commercial grade support. Feel free to contact me by any of the above methods.

The future of wxIFM
As I said earlier, I will not be making any future wxIFM releases in the
forseeable future. Fear not, for wxIFM will continue to live on, allbeit in
another toolkit. That other toolkit is being written by me and a few people from
irc who dislike wxwidgets. For information, navigate to irc.freenode.net/#cpaf.

If you would like to see the current wxIFM improve, feel free to add on to it and
contact me with your results.

That about wraps it up. I hope you enjoy wxIFM.
