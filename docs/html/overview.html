The Basics</a></h2>
wxIFM consists of three basic concepts<br>
 1. <a class="el" href="overview.html#basics1">The wxIntefaceManager Object</a><br>
 2. <a class="el" href="overview.html#basics2">Plugins</a><br>
 3. <a class="el" href="overview.html#basics3">Components</a><br>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="basics1">
The wxIntefaceManager Object</a></h3>
This is the main object of the wxIFM system. It sits atop the window it is managing, intercepts some of its events, and passes on the appropriate plugin events to the plugin event handling chain for processing. <br>
 More info: <a class="el" href="overview.html#detail1">wxInterfaceManager Details</a><h3><a class="anchor" name="basics2">
Plugins</a></h3>
Plugins are really event handlers that are responsible for handling plugin events sent by the <a class="el" href="classwx_interface_manager.html">wxInterfaceManager</a> object. In wxIFM, all functionality is implemented as event handlers, and everything is done via an event. In this case, the events are more like commands for plugins. Each plugin is free to process the command (or not). <br>

Components</a></h3>
Components make up the "stuff" of an interface. In the default implementation provided by wxIFM, there are two kinds of components, Containers, and Panels. Even though they are two conceptually different objects, they are both the same thing inside wxIFM, that thing being the <a class="el" href="classwx_i_f_m_component.html">wxIFMComponent</a> class. <br>

In Detail</a></h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="detail1">
wxInterfaceManager Details</a></h3>
This object is the entry point into wxIFM for your library. It handles some events for you, namely EVT_SIZE, allows you to add children to be managed, save and load interface states (soon), and switch between loaded interface plugins (soon). There isn't a whole lot to be said about this class, and more details can be found in the <a class="el" href="classwx_interface_manager.html">wxInterfaceManager</a> documentation.<h3><a class="anchor" name="detail2">
Plugin Details</a></h3>
There are really two kinds of plugins<br>
 1. <a class="el" href="overview.html#detail2_a">Interface Plugins</a><br>
 2. <a class="el" href="overview.html#detail2_b">Extension Plugins</a><br>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="detail2_a">
Interface Plugins</a></h4>
This kind of plugin is responsible for implementing a given type of interface. The default interface plugin provided by wxIFM implements an MSVC8 style interface. A plugin that implements an MSVC6 style interface, or a Photoshop style interface would also be considered an interface plugin.<p>
It is possible to have more than one interface plugin for a given <a class="el" href="classwx_interface_manager.html">wxInterfaceManager</a> object. Only one may be active at a time, active meaning that it is the currently selected plugin. Switching between interface plugins is not fully realized at this stage, but it will be soon.<h4><a class="anchor" name="detail2_b">
Extension Plugins</a></h4>
Extension plugins are added to an interface plugin to "extend" its functionality. Plugins that add captions to components, or invents its own type of component would be considered an extension plugin. In the default implementation, the functionality for Containers and Panels is implemented by an extension plugin for each component type. The interface plugin simply manages these objects in a general fashion and delegates the implementation of the objects to extension plugins.<p>
Extension plugins are usually written generally so that they may extend any given interface plugin. However, it is possible to write extension plugins that only extend a given interface plugin.<h3><a class="anchor" name="detail3">
Component Details</a></h3>
Components in wxIFM are all objects of the <a class="el" href="classwx_i_f_m_component.html">wxIFMComponent</a> class. The component class by itself is nothing special. The only thing it does is provide a mechanism for adding data storage dynamically. When plugins need to store certain data on a per component basis, the plugin will derived a data storage class from the wxIFMComponentDataBase class. It then adds an instance of this data class to the components that it requires data storage for.<p>
All components are given an instance of the wxIFMComponentData data storage object. This class contains very basic storage for things every component must have, and it is always present in any component.<p>
The wxIFMComponent::m_type member is what distinguishes one kind of component from another. It is private, so accessing it should be done via <a class="el" href="classwx_i_f_m_component.html#b01aa636f4384cb72ec4a6e992b10682">wxIFMComponent::GetType()</a>. <hr size="1"><address style="align: right;"><small>Generated on Thu Dec 1 00:49:14 2005 for wxIFM by&nbsp;
